## User Stories

Here, the product manager represents the person that has supplied me the brief/specification.

```
As a Product Manager,
So that I can play alone,
I want a computer player.

As a Product Manager,
So that I can play against a friend, the computer or watch computer-computer play,
I want to select the game type.

I want the computer player to be unbeatable.
